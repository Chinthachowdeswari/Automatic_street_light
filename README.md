# Automatic_street_light

Most of the places have automatic street light which can sense the daytime and nighttime, and automatically turns on  and off according the night and day. Here we are extending this project by adding one more constraint to turn on the light that is Street light will only glow if there is darkness and someone is passing through the street. The main objective of this project is to reduce the power consumption by glowing the Street light only when it is needed. In this project we are demonstrating the prototype of the Smart Street Light with 3 IR sensors, 1 LDR sensor and 3 LEDs - each representing one street light. We will also update the LDR sensor data to the ThingSpeak and control the LEDs (Street lights) over the internet from anywhere in the world.

Thingspeak

   ThingSpeak is a cloud based data platform which is used to send and receive the data in real time using HTTP protocol. It is used in Iot applicaiotn to store and monitor the    data from anywhere in the world over internet
